  If you are curious to find out how to calculate IP, TCP, ICMP header checksum
in real C programs, then this is the right place for you.

  If you want to get a basic understanding of the inner workings of programs like
"ping" and "traceroute", then this is the right place for you.

  This repository "currently" contains my own implementation of "ping" and
"traceroute" which has very limited functionality.
